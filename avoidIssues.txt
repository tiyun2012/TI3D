# Avoid Issue Cache & Best Practices
# Use this file to context-load the AI before refactoring to prevent regressions.

---

### 1. GENERAL / ARCHITECTURE
- **PRESERVE FEATURES:** Never remove existing functionality during optimization. If replacing a loop or system, ensure the new implementation covers all previous use cases (e.g., selection highlighting, grid toggling).
- **SOURCE OF TRUTH:** The `engineInstance` (ECS + SceneGraph) is the source of truth. React components (`SceneView`, `Inspector`) should sync *from* the engine, not drive it directly.
- **TYPESCRIPT STRICTNESS:** Respect strict type boundaries. Do not pass `Float32Array` where `ArrayBuffer` is expected without proper casting or union types in helper signatures.

---

### 2. NODE GRAPH (`components/NodeGraph.tsx`)
- **AVOID RELATIVE UNITS:** Do NOT use CSS classes (e.g., `h-9`, `p-2`, `rem`) for node headers or ports.
  - **Reason:** DOM element sizes must exactly match the `GraphMath` constants used to draw SVG wires.
  - **Solution:** Use explicit pixel values in `style={{ height: HEADER_HEIGHT, ... }}`.
- **PERFORMANCE:** Avoid `array.find()` in render loops or drag handlers. Use `Map<string, Node>` for O(1) lookups.
- **ACCESSIBILITY:** All inputs and interactive elements must have `aria-label` or `title`. Missing these causes Severity 8 build failures.
- **DEBOUNCING:** Debounce the `compileGraph` call. Do not run heavy graph logic on every `mousemove` event.

---

### 3. RENDERER (`services/renderers/WebGLRenderer.ts`)
- **VIEWPORT SYNC:** Always check and set `gl.viewport` at the start of the `render()` frame. Do not rely solely on a `resize` event listener, as it may miss the initial layout pass.
- **BUFFER BINDING:** Explicitly `bindBuffer` immediately before calling `vertexAttribPointer`. Do not assume the buffer is still bound from previous operations.
- **TEXTURE SAFETY:** When using `sampler2DArray` (WebGL2), you MUST explicitly set `TEXTURE_WRAP_S` and `TEXTURE_WRAP_T`. Failing to do so causes black textures on some drivers.
- **CULLING RISKS:** Be cautious with `gl.enable(gl.CULL_FACE)`. If geometry disappears, disable culling first to rule out winding order mismatches.
- **BUFFER ORPHANING:** When updating instance data, call `gl.bufferData(..., gl.DYNAMIC_DRAW)` to orphan the buffer before `gl.bufferSubData`. This prevents GPU pipeline stalls.

---

### 4. SCENE VIEW & CAMERA (`components/SceneView.tsx`)
- **3D PANNING:** Do not use 2D screen X/Y offsets for camera panning.
  - **Solution:** Calculate the camera's local "Right" and "Up" vectors and apply movement along those vectors to ensure panning follows the camera's orientation.
- **LINTER COMPLIANCE:** Ensure all toolbar buttons (Icons) have `title` attributes.

---

### 5. SCENE GRAPH (`services/SceneGraph.ts`)
- **ITERATION OVER RECURSION:** Avoid recursive functions for `updateWorldMatrix` or `setDirty`. Use a stack-based `while` loop to prevent stack overflow crashes in deep hierarchies (100+ entities).

---

### 6. COMMENT 
- **PRESERVATION:** Keep all comments during refactoring. 

---

### 7. CSS & COMPATIBILITY
- **VENDOR PREFIXES:** Always include standard vendor prefixes for newer CSS features to ensure cross-browser support (e.g., `-webkit-backdrop-filter` alongside `backdrop-filter`).
### 8. LOST
-** Ensure no features are lost.
